The files in the filter_generator folder are from the 
[colorfilter_generator](https://pub.dev/packages/colorfilter_generator) package, 
created by hsbijarniya. I have optimized some code which fit better to
pro_image_editor, but these changes are not suitable for a pull request. 
Nonetheless, special thanks for this great package.
